# üèó clone_Toptal
My first project in a coding boot camp. 

After a month of learning web development, since I cannot think of a concept for my project, I just tried to copy the layout of a website I stumbled upon. [[ Toptal ](https://www.toptal.com/)]

## üß∞ How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap <br>

_Q: What do you want to do?_ <br>
A: Become a great programmer

_Q: What is the benefit of doing this?_<br>
A: I like being good at something. Becoming a great developer looks nice to me :)

The questions did not help me think of an idea for this project.

When I settled to just copying a webpage, I saw Toptal and said to myself, _"This looks easy"_. Man, was I wrong!

I had the content. I had the design. The next thing to do was to code.

I started by dividing the page into sections.
- Navbar
- Hero Section
- Sponsors / Trusted by Section
- Carousel Part
- Pitch 1 (Leverage World-class Talent)
- Pitch 2 (Build Amazing Teams on Demand)
- Pitch 3 (Hiring made easy)
- Some members of the workforce Section
- Why Organizations Choose Us
- Collaboration with Leading Brands
- Reviews
- Publications
- Footer

That was a lot.

One of my classmates mentioned that **mobile-first** approach is easier. Bootstrap operates with the same philosophy. I went with this method.

Then I started coding the divs. Starting from the _easiest_ part that I think I can actually do. Since then, I really was time-conscious and I want to at least show a _basic version of a product that meets the minimum necessary requirements for use but can be adapted and improved in the future, especially after customer feedback._

I didn't know what MVP was while doing this but I think I already had the sense for it.

Searched for appropriate icons, logo, pictures. Section after section, trouble after trouble, google to stackoverflow.

### It is all about thinking what to do, how to do it, where to find the answers, and how to seek for help.

## üõ† Optimizations
I created this with divs. a lot of them. Usage of HTML5 semantics would have been nice.

There is a bug in the carousel. The timeout counter does not reset after a click. <br> 
See what I'm talking about by clicking rapidly a carousel image multiple times, then notice what happens next.

I said it's a clone but there are a few parts where I changed how things should appear or I have no idea how to implement.

## üìö Lessons Learned
Content creation is tough.

While searching for ideas for a project, I encountered Software Development Life Cycle.

![SDLC](https://theblogreaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sdlc.png)

I was stuck on the planning part. I think planning must be the most time-consuming phase in the SDLC.

A CSS style can be activated through JavaScript. <br>
When I searched and implemented the solution for ```changing the background color of nav on scroll```, and it worked! ‚Äî That was one awesome moment.

There are lots of CSS properties I used that I didn't know before doing this project.

Bootstrap makes styling way easier. After being away from HTML and CSS, then coming back, I took me so long to style my own nav and make it responsive just by using CSS.

### I learned enough to know that there is still so much to absorb..
